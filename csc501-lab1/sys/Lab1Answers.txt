What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies and the original scheduling policy in XINU?

Linux Scheduler

Advantages:
1. It requires less CPU processing time. This is because the process runs entire quantum time unless it is suspended. 
2. The decsion making process is based on how many times the process has run in the past. This is useful in case of processes with same priority. 
3. There is no starvation problem. 
4. The duration of time the process runs is based on its prioirty. 
      
Disadvantages
1. Computation overhead. 
2. If the number of processes is big, the scheduler may use a notable amount of the processor time itself. Picking the next task to run requires iteration 
   through all currently planned tasks, so the scheduler runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of the planned processes.

Multi Queue Scheduler

Advantages:
1. The scheduling policy is fair. 
2. Boosts interactivity.

Disadvantages:
1. Large number of context switches. 
2. Finding the next process involves a complexity of O(n).

Original Scheduling Policy

Advantages:
1. Fast response time of rescheduling.
2. Equal execution time for processes in the queue. 

Disadvantages:
1. Starvation problem, some processes in the normal queue may take a long time to get executed.
